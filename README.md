I publish a newsletter called [Do the Opposite](https://dotheopposite.substack.com/) every other week. It's main focus is providing practical tips and techniques for improving the quality of your life - drawing from a wide variety of themes, listed below.

The themes covered are:
- **Habit Change**. Learn how to successfully acquire good habits and how to quit bad ones.
- **Book Recommendations & Takeaways**. Get awesome book recommendations and golden nuggets of wisdom extracted from these books so you can put them into action right away!
- **Personal Finance**. Even tiny change you make about how you manage your money will bring mind-boggling results over time. Find out what these changes are!
- **Starting a Business**. Whether you're a wanna-be indie maker or want to become the next Elon Musk, you will find some great resources here!
- **Overcoming Creative Blocks**. Together we explore how to beat the Resistance and finish that project you've been day-dreaming about.
- **Minimalism** Living with less has lots of benefits: reduced stress, less cleaning, better finances and a lot more!

## Want to change other habits?

Check out [the #100DaysOfX Challenges Project](http://100daysofx.com/). Changing your habits you are changing your life. Remember that the best time to start is always NOW.

I recommend that you commit to no more than 2-3 challenges at a time, ideally 2. If you are doing the #100DaysOfCode which involves a lot of mental activity, try the [#100DaysOfHealth](http://100daysofx.com/where-x-is/health/), or [#100DaysOfFitness](http://100daysofx.com/challenges/) challenges. There is so much more on the site, check all of them out and choose the ones you want to acquire! Languages, writing, meditation, journaling, cooking, and more!
